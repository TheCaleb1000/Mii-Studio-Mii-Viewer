*(Make Sure To Save Both Files, As You Will Need Them Later.)*

## Step One: Using Mii Studio
This Is All Based Around One Website: Mii Studio.
Mii Studio Is A Nintendo Made Website Where You Can Make Miis For Your Nintendo Account. Here Is The Website Link: 
https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwinupXm5bP-AhV4nWoFHatUAoEQFnoECAkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.nintendo.com%2Fmii_studio&usg=AOvVaw0L58_OonAJ6l9rl9VFup9G


( Pretty Sure You Need A Nintendo Account, Which Are Free. )

Once You Are In, Make A Mii, And Immediatly Save It.
Now Lets Move On To The Next Part.
## Step 2: TGR Code
Once You Are On The Mii Studio Website, Open An Other Tab, And Paste The URL Found On The 1st File You Downloaded. (TGR_Code.txt) Follow The Files Instructions. Now Find The Mii Code. It Should Look Like This:


*"mii_studio_code":"08007f0308030408030e0301050417020a00000900000047040c0c1300570004000214041306130b04000a030109"*

(Note: Your Mii Studio Code Will Depend On The User, So They Are All Different.)

Save That Code For Later. You'll Need It.

## Step 3: Using The JavaScript
Now It's Time For The Third Part: Making This Work.
Go To The Mii Studio Tab, Go To The Mii You Made Earlier, Press Edit. Once In The Editing Screen, Paste The JavaScript Into The URL Bar.
(Make Sure JavaScript Is Enabled In Safari Or Chrome Or Whatever)
It Will Give A Fiew Prompts
Now It Will Ask For The Code. This Is Where You Put The Mii Studio Code. Now Go Back To The TGR Code Tab, And Copy The "mii_studio_code". Paste It In The "Please input the bytes for the Mii data file" Prompt.
Now Enter It. 
## Step 4: Yay!
Once You Entered The Mii Studio Code, Refresh The Code (Only By Reentering The Website Link.)
It Will Ask To Continue Editing Or Start From Scratch. Click Continue Editing.
Boom! You Loaded A Mii!


I Hope You Have Fun Using This To Your Extent. Byeee
