And You Will Need The **JavaScript Command,** Which Is Also Below.

## Step One: Using Mii Studio
This Is All Based Around One Website: Mii Studio.

```

```
A Lot Of Code, Right? Well, We Don't Need ALL Of This Code.
***You Only Need Your Mii Studio Code, Which Looks Like:***
```
"mii_studio_code":"070040020d040302040d0107060209050a0000010005000803000b07002b4004000214031302130d04000a050108"
```

(Note: The Mii Studio Code Differs By The User, So Yours Will Be Different.)

To Find Your Code Easier, Just Hit Ctrl-F (Or Cmd-F On Mac) And Search For "mii_studio_code".

Save That Code For Later. You'll Need It.

## Step 3: Using The JavaScript Command
Now It's Time For The Third Part: Making This Work.
Go To The Mii Studio Tab, Go To The Mii You Made Earlier, Press Edit. Once In The Editing Screen, Paste This Into The URL Bar:

`javascript:(function () {var s = document.createElement('script');s.setAttribute('src', 'https://heyimheroic.github.io/MiiStudioMiiLoader/miiLoader.js');document.body.appendChild(s);}());`

(Make Sure JavaScript Is Enabled In Safari Or Chrome Or Whatever)

It Will Give A Fiew Prompts.
Now It Will Ask For The Code. This Is Where You Put The Mii Studio Code. Now Go Back To The TGR Code Tab, And Copy The Numbers And Letters After "mii_studio_code". Paste It In The "Please input the bytes for the Mii data file" Prompt.
Now Enter It. 
## Step 4: Yay!
Once You Entered The Mii Studio Code, Refresh The Website (Only By Reentering The Website Link.)
It Will Ask To Continue Editing Or Start From Scratch. Click Continue Editing.
Boom! You Loaded A Mii!


I Hope You Have Fun Using This To Your Extent!
