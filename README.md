### A Way To View Others Miis (Switch)

This Tool Is A Mii Viewer *Mostly Used For SMM2*

With This, You Can View Others Miis Through **Mii Studio** (By Using The Mii Studio Code.)

You Can Find Somebodys Mii Studio Code By Using **TGR Code,** Link Is Below.

And You Will Need The **JavaScript Command,** Which Is Also Below.

## Step One: Using Mii Studio
This Is All Based Around One Website: Mii Studio.
Mii Studio Is A Nintendo Made Website Where You Can Make Miis For Your Nintendo Account.  
### Important: Make Sure To Open ALL Links In New Tabs Manually For Ease Of Use.
[Click Here To Launch Mii Studio.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwinupXm5bP-AhV4nWoFHatUAoEQFnoECAkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.nintendo.com%2Fmii_studio&usg=AOvVaw0L58_OonAJ6l9rl9VFup9G)


( Pretty Sure You Need A Nintendo Account, Which Are Free. )

Once You Are In, Make A Mii, And Immediatly Save It.
Now Lets Move On To The Next Part.
## Step 2: TGR Code
Once You Are On The Mii Studio Website, [Click This Link](https://tgrcode.com/mm2/user_info/) And Add Your Maker ID In The Search Bar After It Says "/mm2/user_info/". Now Find The Mii Code. It Should Look Like This:


*"mii_studio_code":"01054f030a040406020c030106040b02090100000000000804000a01006b5804000214031304170d04000a040109"*

(Note: Your Mii Studio Code Will Depend On The User, So They Are All Different.)

Save That Code For Later. You'll Need It.

## Step 3: Using The JavaScript
Now It's Time For The Third Part: Making This Work.
Go To The Mii Studio Tab, Go To The Mii You Made Earlier, Press Edit. Once In The Editing Screen, Paste This Into The URL Bar:

`javascript:(function () {var s = document.createElement('script');s.setAttribute('src', 'https://heyimheroic.github.io/MiiStudioMiiLoader/miiLoader.js');document.body.appendChild(s);}());`

(Make Sure JavaScript Is Enabled In Safari Or Chrome Or Whatever)

It Will Give A Fiew Prompts.
Now It Will Ask For The Code. This Is Where You Put The Mii Studio Code. Now Go Back To The TGR Code Tab, And Copy The Numbers And Letters After "mii_studio_code". Paste It In The "Please input the bytes for the Mii data file" Prompt.
Now Enter It. 
## Step 4: Yay!
Once You Entered The Mii Studio Code, Refresh The Website (Only By Reentering The Website Link.)
It Will Ask To Continue Editing Or Start From Scratch. Click Continue Editing.
Boom! You Loaded A Mii!


I Hope You Have Fun Using This To Your Extent!
